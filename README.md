# React Native Assessment

This project is a React Native application designed as an assessment to demonstrate the use of Redux, Redux-Observable, and integration with Google Place APIs. It allows users to search for places using either live data from the Google Place Autocomplete and Place Detail APIs or mock data for testing purposes.

## Features

- **Place Autocomplete:** Search for places using a text input that provides suggestions.
- **Place Details:** Fetch information about a selected place.
- **Map Integration:** Display the selected place on a map using React Native Maps.
- **State Management:** Manage state with Redux and handle asynchronous API calls with Redux-Observable.
- **UI Components:** Built with Ant Design for React Native for a polished, user-friendly interface.
